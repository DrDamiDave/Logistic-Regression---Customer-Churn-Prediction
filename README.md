# Logistic-Regression---Customer-Churn-Prediction

### Introduction
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of one of two outcomes. It models the relationship between a dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a logistic function (sigmoid curve). The output is a probability value between 0 and 1, which can be thresholded to make a binary decision.. Logistic regression is employed here to build a predictive model that classifies customers into "churn" or "no churn" categories based on their features.

### Churning
A user is considered to have churned if there is a gap of 28 days or more between their consecutive activities.

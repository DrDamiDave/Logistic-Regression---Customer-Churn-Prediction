# Logistic-Regression---Customer-Churn-Prediction

### Introduction
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to understand and retain their customer base. Logistic regression is employed here to build a predictive model that classifies customers into "churn" or "no churn" categories based on their features.

### Churning
A user is considered to have churned if there is a gap of 28 days or more between their consecutive activities.
